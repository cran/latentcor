#' Automatically determine types of each variable (continuous/binary/ternary/truncated) in a data matrix.
#'
#' @param X A numeric data matrix (n by p), where n is number of samples, and p is number of variables. Missing values (NA) are allowed.
#' @param tru_prop A scalar between 0 and 1 indicating the minimal proportion of zeros that should be present in a variable to be treated as \code{"tru"} (truncated type or zero-inflated) rather than as \code{"con"} (continuous type). The default value is 0.05 (any variable with more than 5\% of zero values among n samples is treated as truncated or zero-inflated)
